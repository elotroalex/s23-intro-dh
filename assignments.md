### Breaking Down a Text or Corpus Analysis Paper

On the fourth week of class you will annotate one article from a digital humanities journal working in pairs. Your job is to highlight concepts and words you don't understand, and to try to help each other fill those gaps.

### Class Engagement

This course requires us to be present for each other. This doesn't mean speaking during seminar. You really don't have to if you don't feel like it. What's the point of requiring you to? That said, it is important that we are there for each other, helping each other out, doing our part, asking questions when we don't understand something, answering them when we do. For the duration of the semester we are a collective, the team we have---Yankees or Bad News Bears, we are what we got.

### Midterm Exam

Before Spring break I will pass a list of pain-point concepts and keywords that surfaced from the annotation exercise and in class discussions. Right before the break, we will have a midterm exam to see how well we're handling the onslaught of new vocabulary. 


### (Editing the) Final Paper

The final paper for this class may be the strangest final paper you have submitted for a grade in your whole life. You won't be writing this one alone. You won't be writing it with another person either, not directly in any case. You also won't even be writing the first draft. No, AI will do that. The way this works is simple: pick a topic related to your current research. Using GPT3, or GPT4 (if it's out already) you will have the machine write the first pass. Your job is to correct and edit the work to bring it up to your standards. You will submit the original AI draft, and your final version.
