title: A Dozen Keywords
---

Our Midterm exercise consists of a dozen keywords that can help us get a sense of where our gaps can be half-way through the semester. The keywords come from the readings and discussions we've had during the first half of the semester. Some we have discussed in some detail, others we have seen in passing. As we prepare for the second half of the semester, this Midterm exercise could help us understand areas where we still need to work on in our fierce pursuit of understanding what we read. Once you've settled on a meaning others can agree with, feel free to also add commentary or critique.

## So... what do these terms mean?

1. Network Analysis
2. Null Hypothesis
3. P-Value
4. Algorithm
5. N-gram
6. Principal Component Analysis
7. Feature Extraction
8. Concordance
9. Distant Viewing
10. Clustering Algorithms
11. Similarity Measures
12. Supervised Machine Learning
